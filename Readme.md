# Refactor some 'quirky' existing code
This repository is providing the basic a peice of code running in your new workplace.

# Why?
We focus a lot as developers of creating new code that we know everything in, however a rather large part of it is reworking others work - always for a purpose.

The code exists, but the previous developer no longer works for the company anymore, and you've been tasked to improve it.

# TODO
Based on our discussions can you add the things we discussed?
