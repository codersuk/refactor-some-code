# Refactor some 'quirky' existing code
This repository is providing the basic a peice of code running in your new workplace.

# Whats the code meant to do?
Good question the person nicely left behind no documentation or business requirements...

# Now the business wants to change the code.
The business would like to take this project which has been working as part of a lambda function in AWS for 6 months and expand its purpose. BUt you say, we can't add more because its miss..... what is it missing that you need to refactor it?

# What will they need once this code is part of an API?

# Why would we do this exercise?
We focus a lot as developers of creating new code that we know everything in, however a rather large part of it is reworking others work - always for a purpose.

The code exists, but the previous developer no longer works for the company anymore, and you've been tasked to improve it.

90% of the code I write now, is refactoring other peoples code ... its only at codersuk and my own projects that I get to clean slate develop something.

# TODO
Based on our discussions can you add the things we discussed?
